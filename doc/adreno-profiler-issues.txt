adrendo profiler kernel metrics not usable?

i'm trying to get the OpenCL kernel metrics described in the adreno profiler documentation on the ScrubberCL_Metrics.html page.

however, i can't seem to figure out the GUI and/or something seems broken.

as per the docs, here's the info for my issue:

Adreno Profiler application version, as listed in the about box : 
  4.0.5511.694

Mobile device model and build version : 
  SD820-based devel board: Intrinsyc Open-Q 820
  device usb:2-4 product:msm8996 model:MSM8996_for_arm64 device:msm8996 

Detailed steps to reproduce the problem : 
   follow basic OpenCL scubber instructions (blocking mode, CLI-based OpenCL program); note that the metrics button/drop-down is greyed out at all stages. otherwise flow seems to work. more details on request, not sure how detailed to be here.

A screen shot of the problem :

Binaries of the embedded content used, if possible : 
   on request. would issue be binary specific? is there a particular baseline/sample i should try?

A "Microsoft System Information" file : 
   N/A (ubuntu linux; tried both 12.04 and 14.04, both with mono-complete installed)
