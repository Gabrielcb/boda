# WIP : Getting Started

## Boda config file setup (can be done after build if desired)
### note: all commands should be run from boda directory 

First, copy and rename the sample configuration file from the root directory to the lib dir as a template for yours:

    cp lib/boda_cfg.xml.example lib/boda_cfg.xml

Then, edit the file. Important vars (see below): **alt_param_dir**, **pascal_data_dir**, **caffe_dir**

    emacs lib/boda_cfg.xml

Most variables are only used by specific modes, and in theory none are strictly required. However, due to limitations of the testing framework, currently all paths used by any tested mode must be specified -- but need not be valid. So, don't remove any variables, but don't worry about setting them correctly initially. 

For testing of CNN related code, you'll need binary caffe model parameter files matching (some of) the nets in the boda/nets directory. You can put the model files alongside the nets, or you can set **alt_param_dir** to an alternate location to look for the parameter files (see the comment in the config file itself).

Additionally, for running demos (perhaps those commands listed in the [doc/demo_notes.txt](doc/demo_notes.txt) file) **caffe_dir** should be a path to a checkout of caffe from which to find aux data files (not related to building). For example, the **cnet_predict** mode looks (by default) for the file "%(caffe_dir)/data/ilsvrc12/synset_words.txt".

Some tests may require various other inputs/data files/paths from the above config file to be set properly. Directly examination of the tests and their code may be necessary to determine the details, and some tests aren't going to be easy for anyone other than me to run without help / additional information. In particular, many tests use images (or a least a couple images) from the pascal VOC2007 dataset. So, you'll need to set **pascal_data_dir** to a copy of the VOC2007 data.

Here is some basic information on other vars:

bench_dir: related to hamming distance / obj. detection experiments. untested/unused? probably can ignore.

datasets_dir: some modes expect %(datasets_dir)/flickrlogos, %(datasets_dir)/imagenet_classification/ilsvrc12_val_lmdb, ...

flickr_data_dir: path to flickr logo data in VOC format, used by some older experiments only, untested, ignorable

dpm_fast_cascade_dir: path to dpm_fast_cascade codebase, for old DPM experiments, ignorable

ffld_dir: path to ffld, for old DPM experiments, ignorable

## Boda environment setup: putting boda in the PATH, enabling bash completion support (optional; can be done after build if desired)

The file [scripts/boda_env.bash](scripts/boda_env.bash) is designated as a place to perform environment setup for running boda. In
particular, it puts the boda **lib** directory in the PATH (so that the **lib/boda** binary can be found in the PATH) as
well as running a script to enable some limited, WIP support for bash completion for Boda. All of this is optional; if
you prefer to manage PATH yourself, and/or if you don't desire bash completion support, there's no need to run this
script. In any event it should not need to be modified, and can be run from any location, once per shell, to modify the
PATH and enable bash completion support. To source it from the root of the boda tree:

    source scripts/boda_env.bash

## Build

### Install needed dependencies

(some of the) needed extra packages under ubuntu 14.04 for a minimal compile:

    sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev liblmdb-dev libsparsehash-dev libpython-dev libboost-all-dev

some generally useful other packages for development:
    sudo apt-get install git emacs


### Build Configuration : editing [obj/makefile](obj/makefile) and [obj/obj_list](obj/obj_list)

    emacs obj/obj_list

Generally, the makefile need not be edited, as it's mostly a skeleton used by the python-based pre-build system.
The file obj_list is where you control what software to link with and, if needed, any system specific paths. 
For example, to disable Caffe integration, change `[caffe]` to `[caffe disable]`. 
For initial builds, you may wish to disable various modules, in particular: octave, SDL2, caffe.
In general, for any non-disabled modules, modify the paths as needed. 
The build system will combine pieces of obj_list together with the Makefile template to form a complete Makefile.
This process is driven by regular make at the top level. 
The makefile invokes the python build system by running [pysrc/prebuild.py](pysrc/prebuild.py)
The python part of the build system that processes obj_list lives in [pysrc/boda_make_util.py](pysrc/boda_make_util.py)
Note: Additionally, the python part of the build system that handles C++ metaprogramming/NESI code generation lives in [pysrc/nesi_gen.py](pysrc/nesi_gen.py). 
More documentation of this is TODO, but it should not require any special configuration or attention.

Each dependency of boda has a **build stanza** that starts with a header that minimally has the name of the dependency in []'s, such as `[cuda]` or `[SDL2]`. Each stanza is implicitly ended by the start of the next stanza. Various options can also be included in the in the header for each dependency:

    [foo needs=bar needs=baz] # this defines a dependency foo that has two sub-dependencies `bar` and `baz`
    [magiwrapper gen_fn=foo.cc] # uncommon (used only for protobuf related features currently); declares a build-time generated file
    [SDL2 disable] # used to disable a dependency; it's build stanza will be ignored

A dependency is disabled if it is explicitly disabled with the `disable` option, or if any of its sub-dependencies is disabled.
If a dependency is *not* disabled, they the contents of its build stanza are added to the makefile.
In particular, each stanza should add to LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS to add any need compiler/linker options to find needed header files and to find and link against any need libraries.
For libraries not expected to be in the default dynamical library search path at runtime, stanza may optionally use mechanisms like `rpath` as an alternative to using LD_LIBRARY_PATH at runtime.
By default, both the `caffe` and `cuda` dependencies use the rpath mechanism.
The default obj_list has reasonable default paths and options for all dependencies, but these must be manually altered as needed to match the local build environment.

One special final stanza named `[objs]` (which takes no options) lists all the object files in boda along with what dependencies each has. Files with no dependencies will always be compiled/linked. Files that have dependencies will only be compiled/linked if all of their dependencies are enabled. Files that are not compiled/linked will cause boda to be missing the features/modes/functionality provided by those files. In some case, a 'stub' version of a file/feature is provided for use when the dependency is unavailable; usually such stubs simply do nothing and/or emit an error if the needed functionality is used. For example:

    [objs]
    ...
    img_io.o  # has no dependencies; will always be compiled and linked
    img_io-turbojpeg.o turbojpeg # depends on `turbojpeg`; if turbojpeg is disabled, this file will not be compiled/linked
    img_io-no-turbojpeg-stub.o -turbojpeg # anti-depends on turbojpeg; if turbojpeg is *not* disabled, this file will not be compiled/linked
    ...

In this case, if the uses attempts to load a jpeg file without the turbojpeg dependency, a run-time error will be generated. 

Similar, for the python dependency we have: 

    [objs]
    ...
    pyif.o python
    pyif-no-python-stub.o -python
    ...

In this case, usage of a stub allows for main() to unconditionally call a boda's python init function (py_init()) and thus avoids the usage of #ifdef'd code depending on if python support is enabled. Instead, by linking either the real or stub version of the object, and thus of py_init(), we use the linker to manage feature dependencies.

The final result of obj_list processing will be written to the file `obj/dependencies.make`, and can be inspected like any makefile. 

#### Notes on caffe support: short version: you probably want `[caffe disable]`

Enabling the `[caffe]` build stanza is *not* required for Boda to read caffe prototxt files.
Boda includes its own copy of the caffe protobuf message description file (`caffe.proto`) along with some small amount of copied and modified caffe protobuf related code (in `update_proto.cpp`), both in the boda/src/ext directory.
Using these files that are part of boda, 'basic' caffe support is controlled by the `[caffe_pb]` build stanza, which, unlike the `[caffe]` stanza, probably should *not* be disabled, since many modes rely on it for reading input nets in caffe format.
Enabling `[caffe]` is only required if you desire using boda to use caffe to run nets *from inside boda* (a franken-middleware-mode, if you will), which is useful for certain forms of testing and profiling.
If you do enable `[caffe]` support, you must ensure that Boda's caffe.proto agrees with the one from the caffe build you choose.
I maintain a fork of caffe with a few patches applied to aid in integration with boda.
It should always be in a state that is 'good' for use with the current version of boda.

The main things that are currently patched are:
- tweaks to silence compiler warnings when including caffe headers (only included by caffe_fwd.cc)
- a hack to allow making dropout deterministic for testing

Neither are strictly required for enabling the `[caffe]` build stanza, though.
So, if you're not too picky about what caffe version to use, the easiest path to enable caffe integration for boda is to clone my fork of caffe, switch to the branch below, and point boda to it:

[https://github.com/moskewcz/caffe/tree/fix-sign-comp-in-hpps](https://github.com/moskewcz/caffe/tree/fix-sign-comp-in-hpps)

If you want to use your own caffe version, see boda issue #1 for the three options of how to proceed (TODO_DOCS: cleanup an inline here).

### compile

    make -C obj -j12 

or equivalently, if you prefer:

    cd obj && make -j12


## Development Notes

### Creating a TAGS file/table

The script [scripts/gen_etags.sh](scripts/gen_etags.sh) can be sourced (or run) from the root of the boda tree to produce a emacs TAGS file:

    ./scripts/gen_etags.sh

## Running Tests

### copying needed model files

Assuming you have all the needed model files on some machine in /scratch/models, using where each model is /scratch/models/$net/best.caffemodel, you can use rsync to copy them to another machine. The list of models needed for testing (hopefully up to date, but otherwise a good starting place) is in boda/test/test_all_nets.txt. Here is a sample command to copy the models from the local machine to a remote machine named 'targ_machine':

    # FIXME: UNTESTED!!! needs a /scratch dir already setup, maybe with +t / stick-bit set like /tmp ...
    moskewcz@maaya:~/git_work/boda$ for net in `cat test/test_all_nets.txt`; do ssh targ_machine mkdir -p /scratch/models/$net ; scp {,targ_machine:}/scratch/models/$net/best.caffemodel; done

### copying needed dataset files

Also, the images from the VOC-2007 dataset are used by the tests. Again, assuming they are in /scratch/datasets/VOC-2007/VOCdevkit (with the actual images and such in /scratch/datasets/VOC-2007/VOCdevkit/VOC2007/{JpegImages,ImageSets,Annotations}):

    rsync -a /scratch/datasets/VOC-2007/VOCdevkit targ_machine:/scratch/datasets/VOC-2007

### running the tests

From the boda/run directory, make a test-running directory, and cd into it. from there, run the test_all mode. Depending on which features you have enabled/disabled, you should see something like the below. Note that many of the tests do require caffe support, and so if you've disabled that, many individual tests will fail to initialize, since the 'caffe' computation backend won't exists. So, the part above about not needing caffe enabled above doesn't currently really hold true if you want to run the tests.
